# Objectives 
- Learn how Recommendation Systems are Used for Businesses 
- Practice running a recommendation system using movie ratings/user data 

# Accessing the Code:

The easiest way to follow along with the code is by clicking here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aspratle/Recommendation_Systems_Workshop_Flatiron/HEAD)

*Please note* - it can take a few minutes for Binder to create the correct environment for the notebook. There's a non-interactive view if you scroll down while the environment loads.

Once the environment loads, double click the Walkthrough version of the notebook on the left-hand side (should be the bottom-most file) to launch the notebook.

If you do want to run the code on your own, download Jupyter Notebook and run these lines in your terminal:

1. `git clone https://github.com/aspratle/Recommendation_Systems_Workshop_Flatiron.git`
2. `cd Recommendation_Systems_Workshop_Flatiron`
3. `jupyter notebook`
